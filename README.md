# Genetic Feature selection
Brief experiments using genetic algorithms for feature selection for the regression task proposed by the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime">Communities and Crime Dataset</a> from UCI Machine Learning, written in tutorial form. Please note that these experiments focus solely on the feature selection implementation
# Discretization
# Rules Generation
Generating Rules from Discretized+Encoded data optimized using Genetic Feature Selections. sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifierÂ¶ is used to generate rules in text format with distinct classes based on probability, number of samples and gini index to measure how impure the partitions are.
